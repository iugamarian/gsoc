This is an attempt to complete Robert Rudd's GSOC project of 2008 with XBMC.

./ffmpeg was checked out from: http://xbmc.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/xbmc/branches/gsoc-2008-rudd/sources/dvdplayer/ffmpeg

Build using:

cd ffmpeg
./configure --extra-libs="-lGLEW -lglut" --disable-ffmpeg --disable-ffplay --disable-ffserver
cd gpu/
make

You can then run gpu_player using one of the mkv test files e.g.

./gpu_player ../../Ganges.E01.1080p.L4.1.mkv

ffmpeg-13975 is a version of ffmpeg back when Rudd started out. This is where I am doing my own work at the moment (in the work branch).
